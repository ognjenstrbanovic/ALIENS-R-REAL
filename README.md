# javascript-ALIENS-R-REAL-challenge ðŸ‘½
We here at **ALIENS-R-REAL** certainly believe that extraterrestrial life exists! That is why we have collected all of the eye-witness reports/sightings of UFO's (however reliable that may be) to prove this. The matter will finally be put to rest when we put this information online for the world to see. ðŸ™„ ðŸ˜„  
I've been tasked to create *a dynamic table with filtering capabilites* based on a dataset provided. Highly distrustful (paranoid? ðŸ˜…) of other technologies, the only programming languages that can be trusted are JS, HTML, CSS, and D3.js (it is important to note that the HTML and CSS was given to us; so the website design was already there, but the important functionalities were not).  
Level 1 - *an automatic table with date search*... with the data in the form of an array of JS objects, the task was to "write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting", and use event listeners (specifically from D3.js) to "search through the ```date/time``` column to find rows that match user input".  
Here is the outcome:

![Filtered Table](https://github.com/ognjenstrbanovic/javascript-challenge/blob/master/Filtered%20Table.jpg?raw=true)  


I met this criteria, but, unfortunately, did not meet the criteria for the optional Level 2; this was to set multiple searchable filters - city, state, country, and shape - using multiple ```input``` tags and/or select dropdowns.  
I was disappointed to have not been able to finish the bonus part of this assignment. However, JavaScript was still very foreign to me at the time, and I worked hard to complete the base requirements, so I should not be discouraged!  
Thank you for reading!
